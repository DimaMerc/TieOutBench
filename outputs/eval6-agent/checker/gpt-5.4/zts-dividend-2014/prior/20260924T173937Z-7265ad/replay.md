[reviewer r1] VERDICT: reject
    - L3 escalate is not an action allowed by the governing event. The governing document zts-8k-20140327 announces only a mandatory cash dividend of $0.072 per share payable 2014-06-02 to holders of record on 2014-04-28; it provides no election or reinvestment feature. No DRIP pricing determination should be booked or held for this event. The correct treatment is no such ledger entry.
    - L2 confirm_position cites basis_doc zts-8k-20140327 but books an as_of/quantity confirmation for 2014-04-28 using a projected position. The source position available from the tool is projected from the latest settled position as of the desk as-of date 2014-04-01, not a settled position on 2014-04-28. This entry should not be booked as a confirmed position ledger entry; at most it could be an internal projection outside the event ledger.
